Task 1: Simple Registration Form Using Tkinter

Task 2: Building a Chatbot Using Python

Task 3: Creating GUI to Extract Lyrics from Songs Using Python

`Task 1: Simple Registration Form Using Tkinter`

`Overview`

In this task, you'll create a basic registration form using the Tkinter library, Python's standard toolkit for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The form will include fields such as Name, Email, Age, and Gender, along with a Submit button to process the user's input.

`Key Learning Objectives`

Understanding the basics of GUI development with Tkinter.
Learning how to layout widgets (Labels, Entry fields, Buttons) using Tkinter's grid system.
Handling user input and basic form validation.

`Features`

Name Field: Text entry for the user's name.
Email Field: Text entry for the user's email.
Age Field: Text entry for the user's age.
Gender Field: Radio buttons or a dropdown for gender selection.
Submit Button: To process and display the entered data.

`Usage`

Run the script to launch the registration form. Fill in the details and click the Submit button to see the form data processed or displayed.

`Task 2: Building a Chatbot Using Python`

`Overview`

This task involves creating a chatbot using Python. You'll explore libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or ChatterBot to handle natural language processing (NLP) and create a responsive bot that can engage users in simple conversations.

`Key Learning Objectives`

Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python.
Building a basic conversational agent capable of understanding user input and generating responses.
Exploring rule-based or machine learning approaches for chatbot development.

`Features`

Greeting: The bot greets the user and initiates the conversation.
Intent Recognition: The bot can understand basic intents like asking for information or simple commands.
Response Generation: Based on user input, the bot provides relevant responses.
Fallback Handling: Graceful handling of unrecognized or ambiguous input.

`Usage`

Run the chatbot script, and interact with the bot through the console or a simple GUI. The bot can handle basic conversation flows and respond to user queries.

``Task 3: Creating GUI to Extract Lyrics from Songs Using Python``

`Overview`

The final task is to build a GUI application that can extract lyrics from songs using Python. You will utilize APIs or web scraping techniques to fetch song lyrics from online sources and display them in the application.

`Key Learning Objectives`

Integrating APIs or using web scraping techniques to fetch data.
Building a functional GUI application with Tkinter to display extracted information.
Handling network requests and managing data flow between the application and external services.

`Features`

Song Input: Text field for entering the song name and artist.
Lyrics Display: A multiline text area to display the fetched lyrics.
Fetch Button: To trigger the search and retrieval of lyrics.
Error Handling: Displaying error messages if the song is not found or if there's an issue with fetching data.

`Usage`

Run the lyrics extraction script, enter the song name and artist, and click the Fetch button to see the lyrics displayed in the application. Ensure you have an active internet connection for API requests or web scraping.
